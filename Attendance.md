Our main goal when exploring the attendance data was to determine which factors were significant in identifying students that display some kind of concern in regards to their attendance. It is clear to see that the number of absences increases significantly during the 2020-2021 (remote) school year. The plots below display the significant difference in the number of absences over the course of the 3 years, or epochs.

## Exploratory Data Visuals

The nested boxes above display how the proportion of types of absences changed over the 3 school years, or epochs. The most concerning thing about this visual is the significant change in unexcused absences when entering the remote school year. This increase can likely be attributed to the anxiety and disengagement seen in all students while learning in this remote format.

The darker colors in the calendar plot above represent more unexcused absences. This plot contains information on both high schoolers and middle schoolers. On Fridays in the Remote school year have a much lighter value than other days in the same school year. That is due to classes being held asynchronously on all Fridays during this year.  

The following visuals give a better idea of the breakdown of unexcused absences for different demographic groups. Our choice to center in on *unexcused* absences comes from the aim of the project. Our aim is to identify students at risk, and those who are actively missing class without a reason are the ones we believe should be at the top of the list. With access to a lot of different descriptors for both the students and the courses, we chose to split on the following.
* Grade Level
* Ethnicity
* Subject

This split on grade shows that there was a clear link between unexcused absences and grade level before the pandemic. It almost appears to be a near-perfect linear corelation where the later grade levels are recording more unexcused absences than the grade level before. During the pandemic, we see a different story where unexcused absences increase for all grade levels, and grade level does not appear to have a direct link to determining unexcused absence counts. Once again, we see the pattern of unexcused absences decreasing once students get back in the school building, but still, levels are not what they were before the pandemic.

Although we are hesitant to make any kind of assumptions on causal relationships, we do see non-white students record a lot more unexcused absences than white students in all school years. Even though the difference is evident across all 3 school years, we are most concerned about the large difference in number of absences recorded in the remote school year. Again, we can only speculate, but this data gives us reason to believe that non-white students may require more attention when it comes to helping students become engaged with school in this post-pandemic era.

Lastly, we wanted to evaluate unexcused absences grouped by the subject in which that absence fell. This plot can be examined alongside the acheivement team's findings because attendance and grades go hand-in-hand when evaluating student behavior.
