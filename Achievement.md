## Achievement

When exploring the achievement data, our analysis focused on examining students grades across the same three covid epochs: pre-covid (2018-2019), remote (2020-2021), and return (2021-2022). Each student in our dataset had a unique academic ID, and for the remainder of this analysis we only looked at students that had complete data (at least one relevant course in each covid epoch). The within subject comparison (aka repeated measures) compares the same students to themselves across all three covid-time periods. This was the best way to assess how each student's trajectory changed over time as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

We wanted to see if there was an identifiable difference in trends for students that were in different grades during different points in the pandemic, by subject. For example, is there a difference in student performance for Cohort #1, who were in 6th grade pre-covid and in 9th grade when they returned to in-person learning, versus Cohort #4 where students were older (9th grade pre-covid to 12th grade return to in-person)? We examined this trend by each of the three core subjects: english, math, and science. 

Below is the cohort breakdown by grade level the students were in for each time period. Note we only included students for which we had data in each time period, so starting with the 6th graders in the pre-covid time period and ending with the students who were 12th graders in the return to inperson time period. 

| Cohort | pre-covid | remote | return |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
|   1    | 6         | 8      | 9      |
|   2    | 7         | 9      | 10     |
|   3    | 8         | 10     | 11     |
|   4    | 9         | 11     | 12     |

Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3 had significant differences in GPA across all time periods, Cohort 4 had significant differences in GPA across all time periods with the exception of the remote-return comparison, which matches the overall trend seen in the cumulative comparison above. All trends show a decrease in GPA overall significant time period comparisons with the exception of cohort 1’s and cohort 3’s remote to return comparison, which shows an increase. 

Cohort1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 4 show the same trend for ELA that they did in the overall cohort comparison above.

[Math](https://github.com/roryblakc/3Cavs-ACPS/blob/main/Math2.pdf)

All Cohorts had significant differences in GPA across all time periods. All trends show a decrease in GPA overall significant time period comparisons with the exception of cohort 1’s remote to return comparison, which shows an increase. 

Cohort1 and Cohort 2 show the same trend for Math that they did in the overall cohort comparison above.

Cohort 1 had significant differences in GPA across all time periods. Cohort 2 had significant differences in GPA across all time periods with the exception of the precovid-remote comparison. Cohort 3 had a significant difference in GPA in the remote-return compassion only. Cohort 4 had significant differences in GPA across all time periods with the exception of the remote-return comparison, which matches the overall trend seen in the cumulative comparison above. All trends show a decrease in GPA over all significant time period comparisons with the exception of cohort 1’s remote to return comparison, which shows an increase. 

Cohort1 and Cohort 4 show the same trend for ELA that they did in the overall cohort comparison above.
